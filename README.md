# ArcVite 🌍⚡️

> Next Generation Web Map Viewer with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript

## Overview

This project is a web map viewer application that demonstrates the features of the [ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/). The official ArcGIS documentation lacks relevant examples for using JavaScript with ES Modules and modern frameworks like React (Vue, Angular..). To address this gap, I have created a modern and up-to-date project that summarizes the popular features with a simple and minimal setup to help you get started.
